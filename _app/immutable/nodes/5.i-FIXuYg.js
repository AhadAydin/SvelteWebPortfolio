    like a <em>readable text document</em> to enhance clarity. 
    I aimed for <strong>simplicity</strong> while still allowing interactive elements.

It analyzes and predicts prices using various models such as ScikitLearn's random forest and decision tree.

After filtering the image, it performs feature extraction and uses template matching with predefined traffic sign images on the detected objects.
