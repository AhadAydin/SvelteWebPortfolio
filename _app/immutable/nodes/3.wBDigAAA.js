As monsters are defeated, XP is earned, which can be used to select upgrades from an upgrade screen, continuing the game loop. At certain XP intervals, bosses appear, and with well-combined upgrades, these bosses can be defeated within seconds. As the game progresses, more enemies appear on the screen, leading to more XP gain.","This project allowed me to better understand Unity 2D, create 2D assets, learn about state machines and C# interfaces.

Continuously monitoring the character's position, it loads only the surrounding chunks and uses Level Of Detail (LOD) to decrease the detail of distant chunks while loading water models.","Next, it randomly adds tree and rock models to the surrounding and visible chunks based on the character's position. Then, utilizing Unity's GPU Instancing feature, it renders millions of grass instances directly on the GPU.","This project taught me Unity3D, mesh manipulation, texturing, procedural world generation, GPU Instancing, and shaders."],images:["ss1 (1).png","ss2 (1).png","ss3 (1).png","ss4 (1).png","ss5 (1).png"],link:"/Robotics/Arduino",tc:"bg-teal-800/40"},{header:"Nothing Island",texts:['In 2023, I developed this game where players assume the role of a character stranded on the "Nothing Island".
